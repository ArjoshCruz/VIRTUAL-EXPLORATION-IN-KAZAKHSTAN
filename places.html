              Kokpar is Kazakhstan’s national horseback game, similar to
              Buzkashi in neighboring Central Asian countries. Often called the
              "sport of the steppes," it involves two teams of skilled horse
              riders competing to grab a goat carcass and score points by
              carrying it into a goal.

              Kumis is a traditional Kazakh drink made from fermented mare’s
              milk. It has been a staple of nomadic diets for centuries,
              believed to have health benefits due to its probiotics and
              vitamins. The taste is slightly sour and tangy, with mild alcohol
              content due to the fermentation process.

              <li>
                <b>Health Benefits</b>: Rich in vitamins A, C, and E, Kumis is
                said to aid digestion and boost immunity.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Best Time to Try</b>: Spring and summer, when mares produce
                the most milk.
